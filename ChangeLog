ChangeLog
---------

Version 1.2.0 - ??-???-????:
 - splib:
   - Added subs/functions to 'bits.inc' to handle bit-sets > 64 bits:
       bits.big_clear()
       bits.big_fill()
       bits.big_get%()
       bits.big_set()
       bits.fill()
 - sptest:
   - Added option 'use_hex%' flag to assert_int_array_equals() which if set
     causes it to use hexadecimal format.

Version 1.1.0 - 1-Oct-2023:
 - gonzo:
   - Fixed --version command line argument.
   - Fixed undeclared variable bug in gonzo.check_arg_min%().
 - splib:
   - Changed sys.VERSION to be a 6 or 7-digit integer: {A}ABBCDD
     - {A}A is the 1 or 2-digit major version.
     - BB   is the 2-digit minor version.
     - C    = 0 for alpha
            = 1 for beta
            = 2 for release candidate
            = 3..9 for release.
     - DD   is the micro version if c <= 3.
            If c > 3 Then CDD - 300 is the micro version.
     e.g. 1234567 would be version 12.34.267
   - Added function sys.format_firmware_version$()
     - replaces the 'fw%' parameter to sys.format_version$().
   - Added subroutine menu.process_key().
 - spsh:
   - Fixed --version command line argument.
 - sptrans:
   - Fixed BOUND and CHOICE not being recognised as keywords.

Version 1.0.0 - 13-Sep-2023:
 - First official release including another three years worth of
   undocumented changes; I hope to do better going forward.
 - This is the version used to build the GameMite v1.0.0 code.

Version 1b3 - Unreleased:
 - Changed maximum number of tokens supported per line from 100 => 255.
 - Fixed bug where internal error was reported when input file was not found.
 - Added additional utility code to 'src/common'.
 - Changed naming standard for all code to use a '.' instead of an '_' to
   separate the 'package' prefix from the function/subroutine/variable name.

Version 1b2 - 18-Aug-2020:
 - The package has been renamed to "SP Tools" and the GitHub address changed
   correspondingly: https://github.com/thwill1000/sptools

   It currently consists of 3 programs:

     spflow  - Generates graph of function/subroutine dependencies for MMBasic.

     sptest  - Unit-test framework for MMBasic,
               * rudimentary at the moment and requires Option Base 0.

     sptrans - Transpiler and code-formatter for MMBasic.
               * code-formatting is ropey as I've found out trying to use it
                 on the "Welcome Tape" project.

   See https://github.com/thwill1000/sptools/blob/master/README.md for more
   details.

 - Increased maximum number of tokens supported per line from 50 => 100.
 - Added support for identifiers with ! or % suffixes; $ was already supported.

Version 1b1 - 22-Jul-2020:
 - Initial public beta.
