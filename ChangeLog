ChangeLog
---------

Version 2.0.0-a1 - ??-???-2021:
 - Many changes that I failed to record as they were being done :-(

Version 1b3 - Unreleased:
 - Changed maximum number of tokens supported per line from 100 => 255.
 - Fixed bug where internal error was reported when input file was not found.
 - Added additional utility code to 'src/common'.
 - Changed naming standard for all code to use a '.' instead of an '_' to
   separate the 'package' prefix from the function/subroutine/variable name.

Version 1b2 - 18-Aug-2020:
 - The package has been renamed to "SP Tools" and the GitHub address changed
   correspondingly: https://github.com/thwill1000/sptools

   It currently consists of 3 programs:

     spflow  - Generates graph of function/subroutine dependencies for MMBasic.

     sptest  - Unit-test framework for MMBasic,
               * rudimentary at the moment and requires Option Base 0.

     sptrans - Transpiler and code-formatter for MMBasic.
               * code-formatting is ropey as I've found out trying to use it
                 on the "Welcome Tape" project.

   See https://github.com/thwill1000/sptools/blob/master/README.md for more
   details.

 - Increased maximum number of tokens supported per line from 50 => 100.
 - Added support for identifiers with ! or % suffixes; $ was already supported.

Version 1b1 - 22-Jul-2020:
 - Initial public beta.
